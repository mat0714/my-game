# My Game

## What is this?
This project is my first desktop game created with library libGDX. Player is able to jump on platforms and should avoid missiles. The higher player goes the better score he/she gets. Difficulty is increasing during the game- number of missiles is growing.

Controls:

Arrows: left, right, up, down
